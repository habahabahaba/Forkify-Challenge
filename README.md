# forkify Project Challenge

Recipe application with custom recipe uploads.

# Added Features:

1. Page numbering when showing search results.
2. Sorting results by coocking time and number of ingredients (ascending and descending for both).
3. Separate ingredients fields for entering quantity, units and ingredient description.
4. Button for adding ingredient rows, which activates only when all previous ingredient fields are filled and deactivates if some of those fields are cleared.
5. Added a method for displaying system messages without deleting a user data.
6. Removed a bug where a user could only upload a recipe once and couldn't open the upload form again without reloading the page.
7. Replaced Fractional API with the Fracty API because of stability issues.
